<p>As said on the Concepts page, we encourage you to propose short projects: <strong>2 hours or so</strong>. Now, 2 hours is an awfully short amount of time for software development. Is it really enough for a project done by 2-4 persons? Won't you be spending more time fussing with task division and other <strong>collaboration overhead?</strong></p>

<p>The site is young, and that's something we'll have to see. But we do propose a few <strong>tips</strong>:

<ul>
    <li>Really do keep the scope small!</li>
    <li>Propose ideas which <strong>lend themselves naturally to task division</strong>, with features rather independent of one another.
        <ul>
            <li>Authors: try to think ahead of how you're going to divide the task, and document it in the project description.</li>
            <li>The more people you have on the team, the more features in your breakdown you'll be able to implement.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Try to have a precise idea of what you're going to do before you start it, reaching that point through discussion on the project page. Use the <strong>project page comments to brainstorm</strong>.</li>
    <li>DON'T PANIC! :P This is about having fun while developing with new people.</li>
</ul>

<div class="content_subtitle">Tool suggestions</div>

We don't enforce the use of this or that tool. On the contrary, we think diversity and trying new stuff is the point of this site. Yet a list might be useful.
