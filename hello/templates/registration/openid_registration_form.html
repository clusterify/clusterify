<p>By logging in using OpenID, you won't have to remember a new password just for this site. Yet, you <strong>need to choose a username</strong> to interact on the site. It is <strong>strongly suggested you supply a valid email address</strong> since that's how you'll be notified of activity on projects you joined.</p>
